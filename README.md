## Dev Notes
Expecting Rejection:
The current version of the app has an issue with the registraion. Users are unable to log back in after logging out.
It had been working for most of the day but was a functionality i hadn't thought to test with each change. I am unsure when
I removed the functioanlity and will need help finding the issue. It appears that the user is not being stored in the user database upon registering.

I am submitting the project as is because I would rather have it rejected and be able to fix it with feedback than to continue trying
to solve this by myself.
